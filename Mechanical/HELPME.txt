File: HELPME.txt
Description: This file contains instructions for users and developers to help
    navigate the standard NBitWonder project hierarchy. Instructions are
    provided concerning what the specified directory hierarchy contains and
    what files should be included.

Current Location: <project_root>/Mechanical
Description of hierarchy:
    This hierarchy contains all relevant files for the mechanical design of the
project. Design files are separated into components. Should your design contain
multiple mechanical components, each component should contain its own hierarchy
within <project_root>/Electronics. If the project is large (many related
mechanical components), consider grouping multiple components together under a 
common system hierarchy.
    Each design component hierarchy should contain separate folders for each
version of the component. NBitWonder project versioning begins at 1.0, 
incrementing by 1 for major versions and 0.1 for minor versions. If the project
is a large project (many minor versions for each major version), consider grouping
minor versions under shared major version hierarchies.
