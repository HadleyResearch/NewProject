File: HELPME.txt
Description: This file contains instructions for users and developers to help
    navigate the standard NBitWonder project hierarchy. Instructions are
    provided concerning what the specified directory hierarchy contains and
    what files should be included.

Current Location: <project_root>/Software
Description of hierarchy:
    The Software hierarchy contains any and all tools, utilities, drivers,
graphical user interfaces, and other software used in your project. Software
does not include any code embedded within the project hardware, which is given
its own designation within the Firwmare hierarchy.
    Each software component hierarchy should contain separate folders for each
version of the component. NBitWonder project versioning begins at 1.0,
incrementing by 1 for major versions and 0.1 for minor versions. If the project
is a large project (many minor versions for each major version), consider
grouping minor versions under shared major version hierarchies.
